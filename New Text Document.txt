Title: Automated NLP Web App - machine learning project using Python,Streamlit,NLTK
,Heroku

App Link : 

This is an ML Web app that lets you do all the main text preprocessing task and get your 
data ready to be feed into the model by just the click of some  buttons.

backstory:
I have participated in some ml competitions and have spent at least 1hr getting all
the boiler plate code ready to train my model.

But with the app I was able to do the same things within minutes and I would like to share it with the rest of you.
that said this app is still not **full proof** i have included parameters that i have tested but as have only little experiance 
in this field i possiably cant include all the preprocessing parameters at least not in this version of the app.

**************************User mannual  (whats working)******************************************

That said lets see what this app can go (whats working)

1 Users can remove Invalid character   eg. 
2 Users can remove  all punctuauions 
3 Users can remove digits

4 Users can choose to filter out words shorter than a specified length. (parameter used is N)


5 can remove stopwords:
>>Over here there are 2 options
>>1 nltk this contains stopwords found in the vinalli nlkt library
>>2 extended stop words from this site:  https://gist.github.com/larsyencken/1440509


6 can do stemming all stemmers from nltk are available.	


7 can do lemmatization 

### note:- either lemmatization or stemming can be used at once.

***************************** yet to implement *********************************

1>methods to vectorize can be able to download it. Downloading files is added in
Streamlit yet. 


2> adding more filters eg. to remove Html tags etc.

3> adding options for custom filter and parameters.

4>adding suport for more file formats currently only supports .csv and .xlsx


********************************************************************************

Github link to the project code https://github.com/evilc3/NLP-APP initially i had 
created a desktop app using Kivy but later on to reach more people I decided web app 
was the way to go. You will find all the main code in there.


This project will save a lot of time spend on preprocessing which can then be utilized
in hyperparameter tunning ect,model selection ect.


Please upvote if you find this project usefull.
